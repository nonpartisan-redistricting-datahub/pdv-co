Election results from the Colorado Secretary of State (https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Results/Archives.html)
Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The following counties used shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Delta, Denver, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, Garfield, Gilpin, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Pitkin, Pueblo, Summit, Weld.

Las Animas County precinct assignments in the voter file differ markedly from both the Census VTD boundaries and from maps received from the county. All precincts were revised to match the geocoded voter file and the list of districts assigned to precinct splits. As appropriate, precinct boundaries were revised using Census blocks, the Trinidad municipal boundary shapefile, school district or fire district boundaries, and the parcel shapefile from the Las Animas County Assessor.

The following additional revisions were made to match the 2018 precinct boundaries:

Logan: Align Sterling City precincts with city limits
Montezuma: Precincts renumbered to match county maps
Otero: Align La Junta City precincts with county maps
Prowers: All precincts adjusted to match county maps
Rio Grande: Adjust Precincts 2/3 to match county maps
